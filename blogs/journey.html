            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, I’m Aashish, a Java software developer passionate about creating engaging games. My journey through game development has been a rollercoaster of learning, coding, debugging, and, of course, struggling to bring my ideas to life. Today, I want to share the evolution of my experiences as I transitioned from developing simple games like Ping Pong and TicTacToe to a much more ambitious project—Chess. Each game has been a milestone, shaping my skills, testing my patience, and pushing the boundaries of what I thought I could achieve..</p>
            <h2>Game 1: The Learning Experience (Ping Pong)</h2>
            <p>My first game, Ping Pong, was the stepping stone into the world of game development. To be completely honest, I didn’t write much of the code myself. Most of it came from online tutorials and open-source projects. I was in a hurry to publish the game and get that first taste of success, so I skipped over key steps like understanding the logic behind each line of code. Looking back, I see that I treated the project as a checklist, eager to finish without grasping the nuances of Java development. However, the experience wasn't a total loss; it laid the foundation, giving me insight into the structure and workflow of game creation.</p>
            
            <h2>Game 2: The Working Game (TicTacToe)</h2>
            <p>After Ping Pong, I approached TicTacToe with a stronger determination to improve. This time, I took charge of writing the code myself. Of course, there were still plenty of challenges, and I found myself turning to the internet and AI when I hit a roadblock. But this was a different experience—there was ownership in the process. I poured over each line, testing and tweaking until the game felt polished, or at least as polished as a beginner’s project could be. TicTacToe taught me a lot about balancing simplicity with functionality, and for the first time, I felt like I had truly built something. It was my code, my logic, and my design that made the game work. While not perfect, it was a giant leap forward from my first attempt.</p>
            
            <h2>Game 3: The Complex Beast (Chess)</h2>
            <p>Now, I’m deep into developing my third game, Chess. This is where things have taken a turn toward the complex. Chess is not just a game; it's a test of everything I’ve learned. The logic is intricate, the codebase is sprawling, and the features I plan to implement keep piling up. Every move in Chess is a challenge—pawn promotion, castling, en passant, check and checkmate detection—all of these require careful planning and execution.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike my previous projects, this time I’m determined to build something truly polished, something that not only functions well but also adheres to the best practices I’ve picked up along the way. The struggle is real; the code has already grown massive, and yet, there are so many more features I need to incorporate—AI integration, advanced chess rules, and user-friendly UI. The work is overwhelming, but also exciting. It’s a puzzle, much like the game of chess itself, and I’m committed to seeing it through to the end..</p>
            
            <p>What makes this journey particularly fascinating is how each game has contributed to my growth. With Ping Pong, I learned how to get started. With TicTacToe, I learned how to think through problems independently and solve them. Now, with Chess, I’m learning how to juggle complexity and scale without losing focus on the end goal: a playable, enjoyable game.</p>
            
            <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p>The road to completing Chess is far from over. There are days when the code feels insurmountable, and the bugs never seem to end. But each challenge only makes me more determined. I want this game to reflect everything I’ve learned, not just in terms of coding but in terms of perseverance and problem-solving. Once the game is ready, I’ll be uploading it for everyone to try out.</p>
           
            <p>So, stay tuned, and join me on this journey as I continue to dive deeper into the world of game development. This third game will be the most ambitious project I’ve tackled so far, but it’s also the most rewarding. From here, the possibilities are endless.</p>
